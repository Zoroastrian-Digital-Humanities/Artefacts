# Hall of Ambassadors

Hall of Ambassadors wall painting In The Museum On Afrasiab (middle of VIIth century), showing Zoroastrian priests in a procession during Nowroz.  

A booklet published by the museum describes it as:

"The paintings represented in the central hall of the museum on Afrasiab, are unique for their time and had decorated the reception hall of the house, which was situated several hundreds of meters to the west from the museum. They were discovered accidentally in 1965, during works on a lining of new road to Tashkent.

Probably it's the king Varkhuman's family residence who reigned in the third quarter of VIIth century AD.

Chinese chronicles note that each year in the New Year of Zoroastrians', the Sogdian governors headed a procession to the mausoleum of the parents located to the east from capital (east and the south for Zoroastrians' is the direction to Paradise).

It is possible to see on the paintings two characters with bands on faces; Zoroastrian clergymen still use such things nowadays in order not to profane a sacred fire with the breathing.

As to the geese, they, probably, were intended for Zurvan, whom Sogdians' identified with the god Brakhma - god of infinite time, who had four appearances and his appearances were the feral geese."
